Hue CP
====

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript control panel for my Phillip's Hue lights. It's intended to be accessed over a local network (or eventually saved to the home screen of your mobile device).

At the moment, it's pretty basic, but I'll add to it as I have time.

###Getting Started

It's no longer necessary to manually create the web app user out of band and the script will now prompt you to do this automatically the first time you visit the control panel (thanks, [Jonathan Stark](http://github.com/jonathanstark).

If you want to use the hosted version of HueCP, head on over to [http://huepanel.com](http://huepanel.com) and follow the directions when prompted.

If you're downloading and trying out the code here, simply set it up on your web server (local or remote) and point your browser at it, then follow the directions when prompted.

**Note:** You still need to browse to the control panel from a device that's connected to your local network in order for the app to communicate with the Hue base station, even if the code is hosted elsewhere.
